|                | *inadequate futures: subjectivity, ethics, futurity* |
| Committee:     | Suzanne Bost (director), Paul Jay, Pamela Caughie |
| Abstract:      | 'inadequate futures' argues that building a more equitable and ethical future requires reimagining the relationship among the human and nonhuman forces that co-constitute the world. Reading contemporary literature and film alongside new materialism, animal studies, and affect theory, I position posthumanism as a vital resource for enacting this future. |
| Interests:     | contemporary literature and theory, posthumanism, new materialism, ecocriticism, ethics, theory of the novel, media studies, popular culture, public humanities, digital humanities |
