I recently reviewed Stacy Alaimo's <i>Exposed</i> over at <a href='http://asapjournal.com/'>ASAP/J</a>. The review focuses on Alaimo's utilization of art and activism that foregrounds the trans-corporeal nature of subjectivity and embodiment. By interweaving geo- and biopolitical concerns into her theorization of the anthropocene, Alaimo's work 'reorients attention to the seemingly mundane political and aesthetic practices of co-inhabitation that shape humans and their environments.' You can find the [review at ASAP/J](http://asapjournal.com/stacy-alaimos-exposed-environmental-politics-and-pleasures-in-posthuman-times-alex-christie/).
